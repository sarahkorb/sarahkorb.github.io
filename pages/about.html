    <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi, I'm Sarah , a graduate student at Columbia University in New York City, where I study Computer Science and Machine Learning. I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence, both in its theoretical foundations and in how we can harness its advances for positive societal impact.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>On campus I've contributed to research in LLM interpretability, optimization, and computational neuroscience. I also serve as a technical program facilitator for Columbia's AI Alignment Club and I am a fellow of Columbia's Effective Altruism Club. My work and interests center on AI alignment, transparency, and safety.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Before graduate school I worked as a software engineer in Washington, D.C.</p>
